    'Recycling is an essential practice that helps reduce waste, conserve natural resources, and minimize the environmental impact of human activity. By turning materials like plastic, paper, glass, and metals into new products, recycling prevents these items from ending up in landfills, where they can take decades to decompose.',
    'Recycling also helps reduce greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and more. In addition to this, it helps reduce pollution of our environment, water, and air. Ultimately, recycling is an initiative that helps reduce global climate impacts by cutting down greenhouse gas emissions. It benefits our communities, businesses, and the environment by reducing pollution, lowering the demand for raw materials, and creating new job opportunities in recycling industries.',
