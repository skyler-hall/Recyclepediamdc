# Recyclepediamdc

Recyclepedia MDC is a comprehensive platform promoting Miami-Dade's zero waste initiative across all 35 municipalities. It provides residents with location-specific recycling guidelines, pickup schedules, and drop-off centers to increase accessibility to recycling services throughout the county. The platform educates students (13-18) and residents on sustainable waste practices through interactive guides, event calendars, and games. By consolidating recycling information for each municipality in one place, it removes barriers to proper waste disposal and helps achieve the county's sustainability goals. INIT BUILD 2024 project
