            Since 2006, Dream in Green (DIG) has empowered individuals, especially youth, to take a leading role in addressing climate change and other environmental challenges facing South Florida. By assisting schools, households, local governments, and businesses, DIG helps reduce their environmental footprint. Through partnerships within our community, we develop, implement, and oversee educational programs and workshops that promote environmentally sustainable behaviors among all age groups, with a particular emphasis on K-12 students.

          At Dream in Green (DIG), we recognize that contamination is one of the biggest challenges in recycling, occurring when non-recyclable items enter the recycling system. This not only diminishes recycling success rates but also creates confusion among residents regarding acceptable materials in their local programs.

              To address these challenges, our mission is to provide Miami-Dade County residents with accessible and up-to-date recycling information. By offering clear guidance on proper recycling practices, we empower individuals to participate effectively in their communityâ€™s recycling efforts, ultimately increasing the recovery of recyclables.

              <br />Our platform, <strong>Recyclepedia</strong>, serves as a comprehensive resource for accurate information on what can be recycled. It helps users understand acceptable items in their municipalities and provides alternative disposal options for those not accepted in their recycling programs. By facilitating proper recycling practices, Recyclepedia contributes to higher recycling rates, reduced pollution, and improved community health.
